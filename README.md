# Remote Hell - Another PHP Shell

With Remote Hell you can execute commands like if they're executing in your system.

You can do things like:

rh ls -l

and Remote Hell will execute the command and gives you the output on the terminal.

This permits the usage of remote commands and local commands, like this:

rh cat /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php > wp-config.php

You are sending the content of the remote file to a local file.

It's really simple. But it's really usefull! ;)
